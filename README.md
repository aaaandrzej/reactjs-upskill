## Personal upskill project created to learn React and TypeScript

In case anyone would like to run it, you need to:

- install dependencies with `npm install`
- start json-server with `node src/json-server.js`
- run react app with `npm start`

App should then be served at http://localhost:3000 (and use the json-server api served at http://localhost:3001)
